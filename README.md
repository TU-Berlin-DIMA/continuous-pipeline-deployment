# continuous-training
Repository for continuous training (latex files + code)

## Notes

1- Title suggestion
- Continuous Deployment and Serving of ML Models
- Continuous Deployment of Machine Learning Models
- One-off Deployment and Continuous Update of Machine Learning Models
- Streamlining Deployment of Machine Learning Models

2- About citing "Identifying suspicious URLs: an application of large-scale online learning": the evaluation is done in single node

3- About citing "Adaptive SubgradientMethods for Online Learning and Stochastic Optimization" based on page 2 and second paragraph of the related work is similar to what Adam* is doing

4- Trade off: efficient computation (time, resource) and accuracy
