\begin{abstract}
Machine learning is increasingly pervasive in many business and scientific applications. 
The life cycle of machine learning applications does not end with the training of the machine learning pipelines.
Once trained, these pipelines must be deployed in an environment where they answer prediction queries.
In order to guarantee accurate predictions, one has to continuously monitor and update the machine learning pipelines. 
Current deployment platforms update the pipeline using online learning methods.
When online learning alone is not adequate to guarantee the prediction accuracy, some deployment systems provide a mechanism for automatic or manual retraining of a pipeline and deploy it back into the system.
While the online training is fast, the retraining of the pipeline is time-consuming and adds extra overhead and complexity to the process of deployment.

We propose a novel approach for continuously updating the deployed pipelines using a combination of the incoming real-time data and the existing batch data.
We offer fast sampling techniques for including the historical data in the training process, thus eliminating the need for complete retraining of deployed pipeline.
Moreover, we offer several optimizations such as \textit{live statistics analysis} and \textit{materialization of preprocessed data} to minimize the total training and data preprocessing time.
In our experiments, we show that our continuous training approach updates the pipeline more frequently while using fewer resources which results in an improvement of \hl{$1.6\%$} in error rate and up to \hl{$2$} orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art deployment approaches.
