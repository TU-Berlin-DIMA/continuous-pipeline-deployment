Today machine learning is entering many business and scientific applications.
The life cycle of machine learning applications consists of data preprocessing for transforming the raw data into features, training a model using the features, and deploying the model for answering prediction queries.
In order to guarantee accurate predictions, one has to continuously monitor and update the deployed models and pipelines. 
Current deployment platforms update the models using online learning methods.
When online learning alone is not adequate to guarantee the prediction accuracy, some deployment platforms provide a mechanism for automatic or manual retraining the model.
While the online training is fast, the retraining of the model is time-consuming and adds extra overhead and complexity to the process of deployment.

We propose a novel continuous deployment approach for updating the deployed model using a combination of the incoming real-time data and the historical data.
We utilize fast sampling techniques to include the historical data in the training process, thus eliminating the need for complete retraining of deployed model.
Moreover, we offer several optimizations such as online statistics computation and materialization of preprocessed features to minimize the total training and data preprocessing time.
In our experiments, we deploy two pipelines and models using two real-world datasets.
The experiments show that the continuous deployment reduces the total training cost up to 13 times while providing the same level of quality when compared to the state-of-the-art deployment approaches.
